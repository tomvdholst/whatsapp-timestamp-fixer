# WhatsApp Timestamp Fixer

A Python script that restores the **DateTimeOriginal** EXIF metadata in images shared via by extracting the timestamp from its filename.

WhatsApp often removes photo metadata, but it encodes the original date/time in the filename. This script parses the filename, reconstructs the timestamp, and restores it to the image metadata.
